For all TODOs that are more general

* Contexts EVERYWHERE
* Put notifications in 
* See if we can get tokens into temp files rather than the standard locations
* Interface a bunch of things if possible
* Check all the errors to make sure they're the right level, and useful
* Write unit tests
* Metrics for Prometheus
* RPM stuff
    * In addition to managed-proxies stuff, make sure that we create /var/lib/managed-tokens owned by rexbatch
* In-code documentation
* Check import order in all files
* Documentation on github
* Get a license for this repo
* Remove this file from repo.  From this point on, all TODOs should be issues in the github repo
