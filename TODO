For all TODOs that are more general

* Interface a bunch of things if possible
* Check all the errors to make sure they're the right level, and useful
* Write unit tests
* Metrics for Prometheus
* RPM stuff
    * In addition to managed-proxies stuff, make sure that we create /var/lib/managed-tokens owned by rexbatch
* In-code documentation
* Check import order in all files
* Documentation on github
    * Configurable timeouts (note, we want production to NOT have these set.  Maybe we can comment them out in the stock file?
        * globalTimeout      
		* kerberosTimeout    
		* vaultstorerTimeout 
		* pingTimeout        
		* pushTimeout        
        * ferryrequestTimeout
		* dbTimeout
* Get a license for this repo
* Remove this file from repo.  From this point on, all TODOs should be issues in the github repo
