For all TODOs that are more general

* Put notifications in 
* For any main() loop where we're going through a number of services, make sure we tally and log the services that worked, and the services that didn't
* See if we can get tokens into temp files rather than the standard locations
* Flags for all executables
* Contexts EVERYWHERE
* Interface a bunch of things if possible
* Check all the errors to make sure they're the right level, and useful
* Write unit tests
* In-code documentation
* Check import order in all files
* Documentation on github
* Remove this file from repo.  From this point on, all TODOs should be issues in the github repo
